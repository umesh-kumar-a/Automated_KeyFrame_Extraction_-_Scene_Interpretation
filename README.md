#  Automated Key Frame Extraction and Scene Interpretation

An intelligent computer vision system that automatically detects important events in videos, extracts key action frames, and generates meaningful scene descriptions using deep learning models.  
This project helps quickly understand long surveillance or accident videos without watching the entire footage.

---

##  Project Overview

Analyzing long videos manually is time-consuming and inefficient. This system automates the entire process by detecting objects, identifying motion-heavy frames, extracting only important moments, and generating captions that describe each scene.

The pipeline combines object detection, motion analysis, and image captioning to create a smart video summarization solution.

##  How to Run

### Run full pipeline
python main.py --input video.mp4

OR

### Step-by-step execution
python extract_keyframes.py --input video.mp4  
python generate_captions.py

##  Output

After execution, the system generates:

outputs/
├── keyframes/          → Important extracted frames  
├── captions.txt        → Scene descriptions  

You will get:
- Only significant frames
- Textual captions explaining each scene
